### Project Description

"Elusive Click & Phantom Keys" is an interactive, quirky web experience designed to entertain and challenge users with two mysterious, mind-bending features.

First, there's the elusive click button‚Äîa floating, uncatchable button that seems determined to avoid every click. It taunts users with humorous sounds and messages, speeds up each time they try to click it, and occasionally changes shape or vanishes, keeping users on their toes as they attempt the impossible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

"Elusive Click & Phantom Keys" tackles the ridiculous problem of having nothing fun to frustrate you when you‚Äôre looking for a distraction. Have you ever wished your buttons were harder to click or your piano had a mind of its own? Probably not‚Äîbut here‚Äôs the solution anyway!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We‚Äôre solving it by throwing predictability out the window! With Elusive Click & Phantom Keys, we‚Äôve created a world where buttons refuse to be clicked and pianos play themselves‚Äîhauntingly, of course.
